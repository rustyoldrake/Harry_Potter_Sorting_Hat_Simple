"The Sorting Hat does everything in the Harry Potter movie ought to, except read the wearer’s mind. By integrating IBM Watson, Natural Language Classifier (NCL), Raspberry Pi 2B+ project board, Adruinos, YUN, servos, LEDs, microphones, speaker, batteries and speech-to-text/text-to-speech services, the wearer is able to express characteristics of him or herself and gets sorted into the most appropriate house he or she belongs to."
