# Harry_Potter_Sorting_Hat_Simple
Some code for a SIMPLIFIED version of the Harry Potter Sorting hat #STEM project that leverages IBM Watson services

## History of the Project (2016/2017)
Back in 2016 - IBM made available a pretty innovative (for the time) natural language classifier - but allowed for optimization and training (weights) for certain topics and idea ideas;  by uploading a CSV file to the existing corpus of the classify - the gen-1 AI / ML could be trained to do inference and provide outputs as desired;   the knowledge graph at the time was quite powerful - state of the art for 2016 2017

We thought it would be fun to try to do a classification for the Harry Potter sorting hat, which is out of the movie - which briefly put - read the minds of the Hogwarts students - and classifies them in the correct house;  in this case, we were going to use the utterances by speech of the wear of the hat substitute for the mind reading;

The chassis hardware and pieces were prototyped by my daughters in our home lab - the ground truth was written by my eight-year-old daughter (a harry potter SME) and performed very well.     

I brought the project prototype to science hack day where the team really took it to the next level!   

From there, there were some offshoot projects in the open-source community and with Ibm;   

Nearly 10 years later with the advent of large language, models, and next generation AI - we've come back to take a look at this project - as it provides a fun foundation for experimentation

Here's the CSV file (ground truth) that is used to train the IBM Watson NAtural LAnguage Classifier (you can modify)

## Team Effort at Science Hack Day Event (2016)
There was a team of about a half a dozen people who were part of our team at Science Hack Day who played an instrumental role in getting Python bits working (Thank you!)

## In short...
"The Sorting Hat does everything in the Harry Potter movie ought to, except read the wearer’s mind. By integrating IBM Watson, Natural Language Classifier (NCL), Raspberry Pi 2B+ project board, Adruinos, YUN, servos, LEDs, microphones, speaker, batteries and speech-to-text/text-to-speech services, the wearer is able to express characteristics of him or herself and gets sorted into the most appropriate house he or she belongs to."
